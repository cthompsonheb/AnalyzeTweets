# AnalyzeTweets
Inspired by the Reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/86cvlr/top_20_words_tweeted_by_realdonaldtrump_over_12/

Users in the comments requested the top 20 words used in tweets by Obama as well as the top 20 words used by Trump before announcing his candidacy for presidency, so I figured I'd have a bit of fun.

# Tools
Utilized Python, NLTK, and twitterscraper to scrape tweets, parse/filter them, and count the frequencies of each word in every tweet. Outputs the 20 (by default) most common words tweeted.
